# Real-time-object-detection-and-tracking

- The primary goal of this project is to detect and track the faces of moving objects and people using a static integrated camera, also capable of detecting the facial attributes of the discovered faces. 
- To accomplish this, the image difference algorithm in MATLAB software is being used, and the KLT (Kanade Lucas Tomasi feature tracker) algorithm is being used to extract the features. We have developed a simple system for single/multiple face detectors in a live video stream using an integrated webcam. MATLAB provides webcam support through a hardware support package via a support package installer.
- Individual tracking is necessary for many scenarios where video surveillance of human activity is being used. It is necessary for security reasons, Every vision-related endeavor requires object tracking. As an outcome, our vision-based system for identifying and locating moving objects is able to grab video without varying the lighting zone in relation to the background against which these people evolve.
