# Real-time-object-detection-and-tracking

The main aim of this project is to Detect the Object and track the motion of an object using image difference algorithm and computer vision. This is done with MATLAB software. Detecting and tracking objects have important applications such as traffic monitoring, security, video surveillance, and many others. Computer vision uses images and video to detect, classify, and track objects or events in order to understand a real-world scene. 
Further the project is divided into two parts- 

1. Detecting moving objects in each frame.
2. Tracking the motion of Object corresponding to the same object over time.
